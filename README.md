## Multivariate Multiple Regression and MANOVA/MANCOVA Analysis

Welcome to the repository showcasing the application of advanced statistical techniques – Multivariate Multiple Regression and Multiple Analysis of Variance/Covariance (MANOVA/MANCOVA) – to analyze student performance data. Here, we delve into the intricate relationships between multiple independent variables and multiple dependent variables, providing invaluable insights for educational policymakers and researchers.

### Understanding Multivariate Multiple Regression
In our exploration of Multivariate Multiple Regression, we harness the power of Python libraries like `statsmodels`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`. Through a comprehensive analysis, we aim to unravel the complex web of factors influencing student performance across various academic subjects and programs.

### Exploring MANOVA
Our journey into the realm of MANOVA unveils the multifaceted nature of student performance differences among different academic programs. By employing sophisticated statistical techniques, we shed light on the interconnectedness of multiple dependent variables and their relationship with program types.

### Extending Analysis with MANCOVA
In the pursuit of deeper understanding, we extend our analysis with MANCOVA – a method that integrates additional covariates, such as socioeconomic status (SES), into the equation. This expanded perspective enables us to unravel the nuanced interactions between program types and SES factors, providing actionable insights for policymakers and educators.
